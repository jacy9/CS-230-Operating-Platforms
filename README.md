# CS-230-Operating-Platforms
## 1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements.
The client, The Gaming Room, owns an Android game called Draw It or Lose It. It is a team-based guessing game where players identify images within a time limit. The company wanted to expand it into a web-based version that works on multiple platforms. The new design needed to support multiple teams, players, and unique names. It also required that only one game instance run in memory at a time.

## 2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I organized the information clearly and kept the writing consistent. Each section connects to the client’s goals and technical needs. I explained my choices, such as recommending Windows Server, NTFS storage, and virtual memory management. My explanations were focused and easy to follow.


## 3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The design document helped me plan before writing code. It made me think about how the system should work as a whole. Defining requirements and architecture first gave me a clear path. It also helped me understand how design patterns, like the Singleton, affect the code. This process reduced mistakes and made development smoother.


## 4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the Evaluation section. I would add more details about deployment and performance testing. I would also include notes about using cloud hosting and scalability. These changes would make the section more complete.


## 5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I focused on performance, accessibility, and ease of use. I made sure users could check for duplicate names and enjoy smooth gameplay. Meeting user needs is important because it makes the software practical and enjoyable. When users have a good experience, the game is more successful.


## 6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I started by breaking the project into sections: requirements, design, and recommendations. I used UML diagrams to show class relationships. In the future, I would use the same structured approach. I would also add flowcharts, prototypes, and user feedback to improve the design.
